# M25 HACKTOBERFEST CHALLENGE

Yay!🎉🎉  It's another month of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

### What is Hacktoberfest?🤔
Hacktoberfest is an open-source challenge hosted by Digital Ocean in collaboration with GitHub and other companies. This hackathon requires you to make at least 4 contributions to Open Source throughout the month of October. This is a great opportunity to contribute to open source and win some amazing prizes along the way.

Hacktoberfest simply entails contributing to open source projects (like this one). An open source project is one that is accessible to the general public to contribute to. (_think Wikipedia but without the fake information_).

_This year, only the first **50,000 participants** get free merch! The time to make that contribution is now!_
