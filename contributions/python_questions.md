###Question 1
Write a function that given a year as an input, determines whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.
**For example**
```python
def leap_year_checker(year):
    #code that checks if it is a leap year
```

The input format is an integer (year) and the output format is a boolean(True or False).
